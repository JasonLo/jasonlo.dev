## 1) uv for pure Python

Use **uv** when the project is Python-only and depends on PyPI packages.

**When to use**

* Standard Python libraries
* No system-level dependencies
* Lightweight services, scripts, notebooks

**Why**

* Extremely fast dependency resolution and install
* Lockfile support for reproducibility
* Simple workflow

```bash
uv init
uv add fastapi pandas
uv run python app.py
```

This covers most data science utilities, APIs, and internal tools.

## 2) Pixi for complex dependencies

Use **Pixi** when you need Python plus non-Python dependencies such as CUDA, system libraries, or compiled packages.

**When to use**

* Mixed language stacks
* GPU or scientific libraries
* Reproducible cross-platform environments
* Teams working across macOS and Linux

**Why**

* Conda-forge ecosystem
* Lockfiles per platform
* Clean isolation of system-level dependencies

```bash
pixi init
pixi add python=3.11 pytorch cuda
pixi run python train.py
```

Pixi handles cases where pip alone becomes fragile.

## 3) .devcontainer for tricky setup

Use a **.devcontainer** when setup requires OS-level configuration, services, or strict parity across machines.

**When to use**

* Dockerized microservices
* Databases, message queues, proxies
* GPU drivers or custom OS tooling
* Onboarding-heavy repositories

**Why**

* Full OS-level reproducibility
* Identical development experience
* Works well with Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces

```
.devcontainer/
  devcontainer.json
  Dockerfile
```

This ensures every contributor runs inside the same containerized environment.

## Choosing the Right Level

| Project Type | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Pure Python | uv |
| Python + system deps | Pixi |
| Full stack or complex OS setup | .devcontainer |

Start simple. Move up only when necessary. Over-engineering environments slows teams down, but under-specifying them causes long-term friction.
