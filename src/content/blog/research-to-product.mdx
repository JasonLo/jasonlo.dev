A few days ago, I had a voice chat with a "clone" of [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) using the fun tool: [SkillBuilder](https://skillbuilder.deeplearning.ai/). It made me wonder: how quickly can research actually turn into something people can use? The release of [Qwen3-TTS](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115) on January 21, 2026, is a perfect example, [open-source projects](https://github.com/search?q=Qwen3-TTS&type=repositories) built on this model appeared in just days.

For decades, the bottleneck between research and real-world impact wasn’t knowledge. It was engineering cost.

Much of this costly, subsidized research is sitting on a shelf with untapped potential to solve real problems. Yet it often stays trapped in papers, prototypes, or dusty academic codebases.

The missing link? Software engineering. Turning validated methods into reliable products used to mean big teams, long timelines, and high budgets. For most niche problems, building custom solutions just didn’t make economic sense. Valuable knowledge stayed in PDFs instead of reaching the people who could use it.

**That’s changing.**

AI coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) are collapsing the gap between idea and implementation. They can digest technical material, translate concepts into system designs, and spin up working prototypes in hours instead of weeks. Suddenly, the fixed cost of custom tools isn't a roadblock, it's a self-driving Tesla fueled by caffeine and AI.

When costs drop, possibilities open up. Research-backed solutions that were once "too niche" or "too small" to bother with suddenly make sense. One engineer can take a paper and turn it into an MVP without a full squad. For example: [this project](/projects/llm-farm-management/).

The bottleneck isn’t engineering muscle anymore. It’s clarity, judgment, and a good problem to solve. As the distance between validated knowledge and deployable software shrinks, the research-to-product pipeline gets shorter, smarter, and more fun to navigate. More ideas become buildable. More insights become usable. The path from discovery to impact has never been this close.
