title: "Ask-xDD: RAG for Academic Publications"
role: "Data Scientist"
year: 2024
link: https://github.com/UW-Madison-DSI/ask-xDD
duration: "15 months"
teamSize: 7
outcomeSummary: "Built a RAG-powered chat interface that makes 17M+ scholarly articles queryable in natural language, bridging the gap between academic research and public understanding."
overview: "Ask-xDD is a conversational search system that lets users query a massive database of full-text scholarly articles through natural language. It combines dense passage retrieval with LLM reasoning to surface evidence-backed answers from academic literature."
problem: "Scholarly articles are locked behind copyright restrictions and technical jargon, making them inaccessible to non-experts. Meanwhile, misinformation spreads freely on social media. There was no easy way for the public or researchers outside a field to get evidence-based answers from the academic literature."
constraints:
  - "Must handle 17M+ full-text articles across diverse domains"
  - "Answers must be grounded in retrieved passages, not LLM knowledge"
  - "System must scale across geoscience, climate change, and COVID-19 topics"
approach: "Implemented a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture: Dense Passage Retriever finds relevant content from the xDD database, then ChatGPT with ReAct prompting generates contextual answers grounded in the retrieved passages."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "RAG over fine-tuned LLM"
    reasoning: "With 17M+ articles constantly growing, retrieval-augmented generation keeps answers grounded in source material without expensive retraining. It also provides transparent citations."
    alternatives:
      - "Fine-tuned domain-specific LLM"
      - "Traditional keyword search with summarization"
  - decision: "Dual retrieval backend with Weaviate and ElasticSearch"
    reasoning: "Weaviate handles semantic vector search while ElasticSearch provides keyword matching. Combining both ensures recall across different query types."
techStack:
  - "Weaviate"
  - "ElasticSearch"
  - "Dense Passage Retriever"
  - "OpenAI ChatGPT"
  - "FastAPI"
  - "Streamlit"
  - "Python"
  - "Kubernetes"
impact:
  metrics:
    - label: "Articles indexed"
      value: "17M+"
  qualitative: "Made academic literature conversationally accessible to non-experts, with initial coverage spanning geoscience, climate change, and COVID-19. Funded by DARPA and USGS."
learnings:
  - "Hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword) significantly outperforms either approach alone on diverse academic queries."
  - "Grounding LLM responses in retrieved passages is essential for trust—users need to see where answers come from."
