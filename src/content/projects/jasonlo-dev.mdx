teamSize: 1
outcomeSummary: "Rebuilt my personal portfolio with a focus on engineering clarity and thoughtful design."
overview: "A personal portfolio built around project narratives — documenting decisions, trade-offs, and outcomes."
problem: "Most portfolios emphasize visual polish but rarely explain the reasoning, constraints, and trade-offs behind technical decisions."
constraints:
  - "Fast static site with zero client-side JavaScript by default"
  - "Simple, Markdown-based content workflow"
approach: "Built with Astro SSG and MDX content collections, structured as case studies following a problem → decisions → impact narrative."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "OpenAlex integration"
    reasoning: "Automatically sync publications using a reliable API with a permissive CC0 license."
    alternatives:
      - "arXiv"
      - "ORCID"
      - "Google Scholar"
  - decision: "Case-study narrative structure"
    reasoning: "A problem → decisions → impact format communicates engineering thinking more effectively than a gallery of screenshots."
  - decision: "Astro"
    reasoning: "Modern static-first architecture with zero JavaScript by default. Fast, maintainable, and visually polished."
    alternatives:
      - "Next.js"
      - "Gatsby"
      - "Hugo"
      - "Jekyll"
  - decision: "MDX content collections with Zod schemas"
    reasoning: "Type-safe frontmatter validation catches errors at build time and enforces consistency across content types."
    alternatives:
      - "Markdown with manual validation"
      - "CMS-backed content"
techStack:
  - "Claude Code"
  - "Bun"
  - "Astro"
  - "MDX"
  - "TypeScript"
  - "GitHub Actions"
impact:
  metrics:
    - label: "Build Time"
      value: "<1s"
  qualitative: "A reflection on my personal growth."
learnings:
  - "AI-assisted development can significantly accelerate frontend implementation."
  - "Documenting personal growth is more rewarding than expected."
