title: "Expert Discovery Platform: RABBIT"
role: "Tech Lead"
year: 2024
link: https://rabbit.obe.wisc.edu
outcomeSummary: "Led the development of an AI-powered semantic search platform that helps UW–Madison researchers, industry partners, and campus collaborators discover faculty expertise."
overview: "RABBIT (Research and Business-Bridging Intelligence Tool) replaces keyword-based faculty search with semantic matching, enabling more accurate and comprehensive discovery of expertise across UW–Madison."
problem: "At a large research institution, identifying faculty expertise often relied on manual Google searches and individual profile pages—an approach that was inefficient, incomplete, and limited in surfacing multidisciplinary connections."
constraints:
  - "Integrate with existing faculty data across multiple internal and external systems"
  - "Restrict access to faculty, staff, and WARF employees via NetID authentication"
  - "Surface relevant, contextual information to support rapid research-to-expert matching"
approach: "Designed and implemented a semantic search system that matches user queries to faculty scholarship. Results are re-ranked based on multiple signals—including relevance, recency, and research impact—to provide more meaningful recommendations."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "Custom-built platform instead of off-the-shelf marketplace solutions"
    reasoning: "Commercial tools did not support the institution’s specific data sources, authentication model, and semantic matching requirements."
    alternatives:
      - "Commercial expertise marketplace platforms"
  - decision: "Semantic search over keyword matching"
    reasoning: "Grant proposals and industry challenges are written in natural language. Keyword search often misses relevant faculty using different terminology to describe similar concepts."
techStack:
  - "Milvus"
  - "Academic Analytics"
  - "Oracle DB"
  - "OpenAlex"
  - "Crossref"
  - "Docker"
  - "SSO (NetID)"
impact:
  qualitative: "Accelerates faculty discovery for industry partnerships and federal grant applications, particularly those requiring interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration."
learnings:
  - "Close collaboration between technical teams and business engagement stakeholders is critical to building tools that see sustained adoption."
  - "There is significant demand for structured, institution-wide expert discovery in academia."
