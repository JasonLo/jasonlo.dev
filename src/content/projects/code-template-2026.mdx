title: "Code Template 2026"
role: "Personal"
year: 2026
link: https://github.com/JasonLo/code-template
outcomeSummary: "Updated my personal code template for 2026"
overview: "Setting up a new project often involves repetitive boilerplate. AI can help, but it rarely matches your preferences perfectly. This template uses a tried-and-true approach to save hours—or even days—of setup time."
problem: "Technologies evolve quickly, requiring adaptation to new stacks while phasing out less-used tools."
constraints:
  - "Portable: works across different environments."
  - "High performance"
  - "Open source"
approach: "Consolidated lessons from the past year into a reusable, flexible template."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "Move away from .devcontainer"
    reasoning: "Not all servers support it well, startup times are slow, and it's too heavy for most of my current projects."
    alternatives:
      - "uv"
      - "pixi"
      - "venv"
  - decision: "Adopt uv only workflow"
    reasoning: "Most projects are pure Python, and uv is optimized for that workflow."
techStack:
  - "cookiecutter"
  - "uv"
  - "docker"
  - "GitHub Actions"
impact:
  qualitative: "Reduced new project setup time from hours to seconds with a consistent, reproducible starting point."
learnings:
  - "Simplicity always wins."
  - "Investing in reusability pays off."
