best_for: "Small, structured cheatsheets and concise information summaries that LLMs can consume directly."
not_for: "Complex, multi-layered information that benefits from interactive queries — consider MCP servers for that."
personal_remarks: "Implemented on this site at jasonlo.dev/llms.txt. A great first step toward AI discoverability before committing to a full MCP setup. Simple to maintain and surprisingly effective for giving LLMs context about your content."
