best_for: "Automating repetitive medium-sized tasks: content generation, audits, scaffolding, and any workflow that follows a consistent pattern across invocations."
not_for: "One-off tasks or problems that require significant creative judgment each time — skills shine when the process is repeatable."
personal_remarks: "A genuine productivity multiplier. I built skills for generating new portfolio posts, running accessibility audits, and producing llms.txt — each takes seconds to invoke and produces consistent, schema-valid output. The key insight is that skills encode process knowledge, not just prompts."
