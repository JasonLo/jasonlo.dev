best_for: "Teams that want guardrails running automatically on every push — enforcing WCAG compliance, catching stale docs, and validating API contracts without anyone waiting or reviewing manually."
not_for: "Tasks requiring judgment calls, architectural context, or nuanced decisions that go beyond what can be inferred from diffs and repo state alone."
personal_remarks: "The framing that made this click: the agent is infrastructure, not a chatbot. It behaves like an adaptive test suite — beyond traditional unit tests, it can enforce architectural constraints, validate accessibility compliance, detect stale documentation, flag risky migrations, and check API contracts. No one waits. It runs on every push and acts as an automated guardrail."
