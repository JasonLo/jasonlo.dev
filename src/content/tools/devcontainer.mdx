best_for: "Team projects requiring consistent environments, fast onboarding of new developers, avoiding 'works on my machine' issues, and complex projects with multiple dependencies."
not_for: "Simple Python projects that only need basic dependency management."
personal_remarks: "Essential for team projects—setting up a .devcontainer once saves hours across the team. With GitHub Codespaces, environment setup friction is eliminated. VS Code integration is seamless, with extensions and tools ready to use consistently. Initial setup can be slow with large Docker images and may be finicky at times."
