best_for: "Local AI experimentation, offline LLM inference, privacy-focused AI applications, and testing open-source models without API costs."
not_for: "Production deployments requiring top performance."
personal_remarks: "Ideal for experimenting with open-source models and evaluating performance on your hardware. The CLI is straightforward, and the Dockerfile-like Modelfile is a clever touch. Recent shift toward cloud-based models reduces its original offline advantage."
