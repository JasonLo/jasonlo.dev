best_for: "Team collaboration, knowledge bases, project management, and teams needing a centralized workspace for multiple use cases."
not_for: "Simple note-taking."
personal_remarks: "Used extensively from 2019–2021 for personal notes. Offers powerful, database-like features and high flexibility, but the block-based editor and reliance on the cloud led me to move personal notes to Obsidian. Still one of the best wiki/knowledge management tools for team collaboration, where its database capabilities truly shine."
