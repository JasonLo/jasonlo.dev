best_for: "Keeping AI coding assistants accurate when working with fast-moving libraries where training data lags behind the current API."
not_for: "Internal or private documentation, or stable APIs where the AI's training data is already reliable."
personal_remarks: "AI coding assistants often frustrate me with outdated syntax. `Context7` addresses this by inspecting your dependencies, fetching the correct version of the documentation on demand, and injecting it into the model’s context. This enables accurate answers even for fast-moving libraries. It effectively acts as a real-time, version-aware syntax reference. In theory, it should be faster than browser-based agents that fetch and parse HTML docs."
