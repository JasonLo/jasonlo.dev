best_for: "Fast, lightweight coding sessions where startup time and responsiveness matter more than plugin breadth."
not_for: "Workflows that depend on a rich extension ecosystem — the plugin library is still limited compared to VS Code."
personal_remarks: "Tried it briefly. It definitely feels faster than VS Code, but the lack of many useful plugins I rely on kept me from switching."
