best_for: "Quick access to commands, keyboard shortcuts, and launching VS Code projects without touching the mouse."
not_for: "macOS or Linux users — it's Windows-only. Spotlight or Albert cover similar ground on other platforms."
personal_remarks: "One of the first things I install on any Windows machine. The command palette alone justifies PowerToys, but the full suite has other useful utilities too."
