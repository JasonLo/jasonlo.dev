## From Research Questions to Product Requirements

Joining Min Learning System was a leap into unfamiliar territory, taking years of academic research on how children learn to read and translating it into a practical product. The work involved developing custom cognitive reading models to simulate children's reading development and building deep learning systems to assess vocabulary knowledge.

The transition from academia to a startup required a fundamental shift in mindset. In research, the goal was understanding and publishing work that advanced scientific knowledge. In a startup, the goal was utility, building something that helped children learn to read better. Success was defined not by statistical significance but by whether the product worked for real users.

This required different tradeoffs. Models needed to be accurate, fast, and scalable. Evaluation focused less on controlled experiments and more on performance in real-world conditions. The standard for "good enough" shifted from theoretical rigor to practical impact.

## Building with Constraints

Working in a startup environment meant operating under tighter resource constraints than in academia. Decisions involved balancing accuracy, speed, cost, and development time. Prioritization became crucial. The focus was on identifying the core value proposition and allocating effort where it mattered most.

The experience reinforced the importance of rigorous model evaluation and experimental design in product settings. Assessing accuracy and reliability was not just academic. It directly affected whether the system genuinely supported children’s learning.

This chapter demonstrated how research skills can extend beyond academia when combined with product thinking and a focus on solving real problems.
