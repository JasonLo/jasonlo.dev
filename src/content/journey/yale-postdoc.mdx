Moving to Haskins Labs at Yale represented a deliberate shift in my research approach—from primarily using neuroimaging to observe the brain during reading, to building computational models that could simulate the reading process itself. Working with Jay Rueckl and collaborating across multiple research groups, I immersed myself in the world of computational cognitive neuroscience.

## From Observation to Simulation

The post-doc fundamentally changed how I thought about research. Rather than just measuring what the brain does during reading, I was now building models that attempted to capture the underlying mechanisms. Developing custom RNN architectures meant making explicit commitments about how reading development might work—what representations matter, how learning unfolds over time, what factors create individual differences.

This shift made theoretical assumptions concrete. A vague hypothesis about "phonological processing" had to become specific architectural choices and learning algorithms. If the model couldn't learn to read in a way that matched human development, it meant our theory was incomplete.

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration

The environment at Haskins Labs emphasized collaboration across methodologies. I worked with teams using fMRI, EEG, behavioral experiments, and Bayesian statistics—each bringing different perspectives on understanding reading. Learning to contribute to projects involving Bayesian latent-mixture models and neuroimaging data analysis expanded my methodological range considerably.

Grant writing and manuscript preparation became central to the work. Learning to communicate computational modeling research to audiences more familiar with traditional neuroscience methods sharpened my ability to bridge different research communities and explain technical concepts accessibly.

This experience set the foundation for thinking about reading research as fundamentally computational, preparing me for the applied work that would come next.
