My three-month exchange at USC was a pivotal learning experience that introduced me to deep learning and its applications in cognitive research. Working on a CNN to read Chinese characters, I began to see how computational models could complement traditional neuroscience approaches to understanding reading.

## From Brain Signals to Neural Networks

Coming from a background in EEG and neuroimaging, shifting to building artificial neural networks felt like learning a new language. The parallels were fascinating—both involved understanding how networks of units process information to recognize patterns. But where EEG showed me what the brain does, CNNs let me explore how those processes might work mechanistically.

Designing experiments to evaluate model generalization and learning efficiency taught me to think about reading from a computational perspective. How many examples does a system need to learn a character? Which visual features matter most? These questions became tools for generating hypotheses about human learning.

## A New Methodological Toolkit

This experience expanded my research toolkit significantly. I realized that computational modeling wasn't just a separate field—it was a powerful method for testing theories about cognition. Building models that could perform reading tasks helped clarify what aspects of reading development we understood well and where our theories still had gaps.

The exchange planted the seeds for my eventual transition into computational cognitive neuroscience, showing me that the future of understanding reading development would likely involve integrating behavioral, neural, and computational approaches.
