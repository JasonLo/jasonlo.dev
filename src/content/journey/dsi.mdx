description: "I accepted a Data Scientist II role at the Data Science Institute at UW–Madison. As a relatively new center, there’s strong opportunity to help shape internal processes and automation. My work involves collaborating with research teams across campus and advising on technical strategy, often around integrating AI into research workflows. The role includes prototyping, research projects, and contributing to proposals and manuscripts. The pace is slower than a startup, but I’m able to work on multiple interesting projects with quick turnaround, which I enjoy."
