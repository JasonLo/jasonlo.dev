title: "New career at Data Science Institute"
type: "transition"
description: "I accepted a Data Scientist II role at the Data Science Institute at UW–Madison. As a relatively new center, there’s strong opportunity to help shape internal processes and automation. My work involves collaborating with research teams across campus and advising on technical strategy, often around integrating AI into research workflows. The role includes prototyping, research projects, and contributing to proposals and manuscripts. The pace is slower than a startup, but I’m able to work on multiple interesting projects with quick turnaround, which I enjoy."

## Personal Reflections

Coming from the intensity of startup life, this transition felt like learning to breathe differently. The slower pace initially made me anxious, was I doing enough? But I've come to appreciate the space it creates for deeper thinking and more intentional work.

What surprised me most was how energizing it is to work on multiple projects with quick turnaround. Instead of being stuck in one long slog, I get to prototype ideas, see them through to completion, and move on to the next challenge. This variety keeps me engaged in a way I didn't expect.

The opportunity to help shape a relatively new center feels meaningful. There's real ownership here—not just in execution, but in defining how we work and what we prioritize. I'm learning that influence doesn't always require authority; sometimes it's about being thoughtful, persistent, and building trust over time.
