Completing my Ph.D. represented the culmination of years of intensive research on reading development in Chinese children. Under the supervision of Catherine McBride and Urs Maurer, I explored questions at the intersection of genetics, brain development, and literacy acquisition—examining not just how children learn to read, but why some children find it easier than others.

## Bridging Multiple Disciplines

The dissertation work required integrating methodologies from genetics, neuroscience, and educational psychology. Studying heritability meant understanding behavioral genetics; examining neurobehavioral correlates meant working with EEG and understanding neural oscillations; and focusing on Chinese word reading meant deeply engaging with orthographic and linguistic theory specific to Chinese.

This interdisciplinary approach taught me that the most interesting research questions often exist at the boundaries between fields. No single methodology could fully answer the questions I was asking—it took combining multiple perspectives to build a coherent picture of reading development.

## From Individual Studies to Research Programs

One of the most valuable lessons from the doctoral process was learning to think in terms of research programs rather than isolated studies. Each study needed to build on previous work and set up future questions. The dissertation wasn't just an end point. It established a foundation and raised new questions that would continue to drive my research interests.

Working with children and families throughout the research also reinforced the real-world implications of this work. Understanding individual differences in reading wasn't just academically interesting, it had practical implications for how we support children's literacy development and identify those who need additional help.
