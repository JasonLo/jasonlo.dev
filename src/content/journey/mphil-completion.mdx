Completing my M.Phil. marked my formal entry into cognitive neuroscience research on reading development. Working under the supervision of Kevin Kien Hoa Chung, Duo Liu, and Savio Wai Ho Wong, I explored how dyslexic adolescents process morphological structures in Chinese, using neurological methods to understand the underlying mechanisms.

This research introduced me to the intersection of linguistics, neuroscience, and education. A space that would define my career trajectory. Learning to work with EEG technology and analyze neural correlates of reading opened up new ways of thinking about how the brain processes language, particularly in the unique context of Chinese orthography.

The experience taught me that understanding reading difficulties requires looking beyond behavioral measures. The neurological perspective revealed patterns and processing differences that weren't always visible in standard assessments, emphasizing the value of using multiple methodological approaches to study cognition.

This milestone also reinforced my interest in applied research. Working with dyslexic adolescents made it clear that rigorous scientific investigation could have direct implications for educational interventions and supporting struggling readers.
