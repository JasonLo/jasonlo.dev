## Reflections on Work at DSI

- The role offers a high degree of autonomy and ownership over technical direction and execution.
- Collaborators place strong trust in technical recommendations and implementation decisions.
- Publications are valued but are not a primary performance driver for my role, allowing greater focus on practical impact and delivery.
- Interpersonal and communication skills are critical to building effective partnerships and advancing projects.
