## Personal Reflections

The promotion itself was validating, but what means more to me is what it represents: that the work I care about—prototyping, advising, helping researchers achieve their goals—is genuinely valued here. In academia-adjacent roles, there's often pressure to publish or perish, but my path has been different. I get to focus on practical impact and delivery, which aligns much better with how I want to contribute.

What I've learned most in this role is that technical expertise only gets you so far. The real work is listening carefully, translating between different domains, and building trust with collaborators who may not share your technical background. I'm proud that people trust my recommendations, but that trust was earned through many conversations, failed experiments, and the willingness to say "I don't know, but let me find out."

The autonomy is both liberating and sometimes isolating. There's no one looking over my shoulder, but that also means I need to be self-directed and proactive about seeking feedback. I'm learning to balance independence with connection, to know when to forge ahead and when to pause and collaborate.

Looking ahead, I'm excited about the expanded scope and influence. But I'm also mindful that leadership isn't just about having more responsibility—it's about creating space for others to do their best work too.
